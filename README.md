# TrapezoidalRuleAlgorithm

General Info: the trapezoidal rule is a technique for approximating the
definite integral. it approximates the region under the function f(x) as
a trapezoid and calculating its area. this approximation becomes more
accurate as the value of n increases. regular-spaced subintervals are
used for calculation efficiency.
